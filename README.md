# hybrid-paper-brooks

This repository contains a paper draft discussing explosion
simulations of the Brooks, et al hybrid C-O-Ne WD model.

The directories in this repository are as follows:

- `paper`: stores the manuscript and figures for the paper. Type
  `make` to generate a PDF.

- `flash-setup-scripts`: scripts used to setup Flash for the
  deflagration-to-detonation transition simulations of the C-O and
  C-O-Ne models investigated in this paper.

- `flash-inputs`: contains input model files and Flash parameter files
  for each of the realizations simulated for the C-O and C-O-Ne models
  in the paper.

- `flash-run-scripts`: scripts useful for running these simulations on
  a workstation or cluster.
