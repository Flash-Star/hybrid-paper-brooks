We thank the referee for reading out manuscript and offering very
constructive criticism and suggestion. We are in almost complete agreement
with the referee and have modified the manuscript accordingly. We address
our changes for each point below. As a result of our revisions, we believe 
the manuscript is stronger and we hope it is now ready for publication.

We regret no explaining the methodology of our deflagration speeds. The 
answer is that the deflagration speeds for input to the flame model are 
from tabulated results. Laminar flame speeds are first 
obtained by interpolation within a
three-dimensional table of 12C, 22Ne, and log density obtained from
prior direct numerical simulations. These laminar flame speed are
then boosted to account for the effects of unresolved buoyancy
and background turbulence and passed to the flame model. We have
updated the text of the manuscript to explain the flame speeds.

Again, we did not explain our methodology well. This temperature is
high enough to ignite the deflagration that leads to the explosion.
Yes, it is a (somewhat mildly) a funciton of composition, but at
this temperature these models have very little evolution left before 
the flame would be born even with differing composition. We have
udated the text to better explain this issue.
