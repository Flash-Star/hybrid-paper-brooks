We thank the referee for reading out manuscript and offering very
constructive criticism and suggestion. We are in almost complete agreement
with the referee and have modified the manuscript accordingly. We address
our changes for each point below. As a result of our revisions, we believe 
the manuscript is stronger and we hope it is now ready for publication.

We regret no explaining the methodology of our deflagration speeds. The 
answer is that the deflagration speeds for input to the flame model are 
from tabulated results. Laminar flame speeds are first 
obtained by interpolation within a
three-dimensional table of 12C, 22Ne, and log density obtained from
prior direct numerical simulations. Here 22Ne is uses as a proxy for
for neutron-rich elements so the interpolated laminar flame speeds capture
the boost due to neutronization. These laminar flame speed are
then boosted to account for the effects of unresolved buoyancy
and background turbulence and passed to the flame model. We have
updated the text of the manuscript to explain the flame speeds
and included a citation to earlier work describing the tabulated
flame speeds in detail.
[NOTE: CHECK THIS. The models include 20Ne. Does the above
description properly account for that? As I recall, nothing new
was done to the tables for the hybrid Willcox et al. models.]

Also, the detonation tests in Willcox et al. were tests of the
energy release of the flame model and not flame speed tests. The 
model identical amounts of energy for both deflagrations and 
detonations in identical material, so detonation simulations were
a simple check of the modifications we made to the model to
include 20Ne in the mix.

Again, we did not explain our methodology well. This temperature is
very close to that required to ignite the deflagration of the
first phase of the explosion, so the progenitor is in a ready 
for ignition state. Yes, it is a (somewhat mildly) a function of 
composition, but at this temperature these models have very little 
evolution left before the flame would be born even with differing 
composition. We have updated the text to better explain this issue.

The referee raises an interesting point about how one might perform
these parameter studies. Indeed, a more realistic C/O progenitor as
would be produced by MESA would be "state of the art." The parameterized
C/O models we chose are motivated by results from stellar evolution and,
in particular, have compositions that reflect the effect of ``simmering", 
that is slow convective burning, in the late stages of evolution as the
WD approaches the Chandrasekhar limit. This effect is observed as
the lower C fraction interior to about r =1.2e8 cm (the solid curve
in the bottom panel of Figure 1). Accordingly, while parameterized, 
the structure of C/O progenitor does reflect our current understanding 
of the state just prior to ignition. 

For this study we decided to use these parameterized C-O models because
being able to construct them to match the central density and 
temperature of the hybrid models allowed us to better control the 
differences between the hybrid and traditional models. More realistic
C-O models would not match the conditions of the hybrid models, and
as we have shown in previous work, differences in density can have
a substantial effect on the yields. 
 
We have added text to the manuscript and slightly re-arranged the 
description to better explain the motivation for our choice.

Something else we could have better explained. The hybrid models in Willcox
et al have a very different structure with the highest temperature, where
ignition of the deflagration is expected, at a radius of about 300 km. 
The profiles are illustrated in Figures 2 and 9 of Willcox et al. Yet 
another thing we have made clear in the revised manuscript.

[Hmmm. I think this is not right. What to say?] 
The estimate of 56Ni yield does follow from assuming the NSE mix is
composed of 56Ni plus equal parts 54Fe and 58Ni, and this approach is
how all 56Ni in the simulation is calculated. 56Ni in (outer) layers
that did not go beyond QNSE would have been synthesized by fusion 
going to the Fe-group and then mixed. As such, the estimate we use 
should be robust. We have added a sentence with citations and an
additional citation to previous work verifying this approach in a variety 
of scenaros to the paragraph.

These are the questions that we are exploring with this and related work,
and we regret not make these clear in the introductory material. We
have added text addressing exactly these issues.

We have substantially shortened the sections.

We appreciate the referee's point. The figures show the evolution of quantites 
like 56Ni abundance with time and are similar to some of the figures showing 
abundance evolution in Willcox et al. Because they allow the reader to both 
visualize the scatter in the yields and also the character of the burning 
(such as the DDT), we feel they are useful and would like to keep them. Also,
they are similar to figures in Willcox et al, which allows comparison
to results from another class of hybrid progenitors. We agree with the referee 
that the discussion was scant and have improved that.
